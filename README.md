Welcome to the lottery app!<br>
This is a basic [lottery app](https://ilottery.herokuapp.com/) using Mongodb with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)<br>

## Getting Started

First, cloning the app:
```
npm install
```

Second, add an `.env.local` file in your root folder to MongoDB connections:
> MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://**username:password**@**cluster0**.tnink.mongodb.net/**dbName**?retryWrites=true&w=majority
> DB_NAME=**dbName**

Third, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
